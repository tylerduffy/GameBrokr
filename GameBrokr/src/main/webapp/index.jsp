	  <h3>
	  	Spread
	  </h3>
	  <p>
	  	Betting the spread is basically like giving one team a head start. When looking 
	  	at a spread bet, you will see numbers next to one or both teams. For example, you might 
	  	see Team 1 v. Team 2 (+5). This can also be written Team 1 (-5) v. Team 2. This means 
	  	that at the end of the game, you either add 5 points to the score of Team 2 or subtract 5 
	  	points from the score of Team 1, and the winner is determined including these additional points.
	  	If Team 1 wins by more than 5 points, Team 1 is the winning bet. If Team 2 wins OR loses 
	  	by less than 5 points, then Team 2 is the winning bet. If Team 1 beats Team 2 by exactly 
	  	5 points, that is called a "push", and all bettors are returned their original bet in full.
	  	<br>
	  	<strong>Takeaway:</strong> The team with the (-) is the favorite, and the team with the (+) is the underdog.
	  	The bigger the number is, the bigger mismatch the game is expected to be. Winning bets are paid
	  	1:1.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>
	  	Money Line
	  </h3>
	  <p>
	  	Betting the money line is basically like playing the stock market. Playing the less risky
	  	move (betting on the favorite) provides a lower payout, while playing the more risky move
	  	(betting on the underdog) provides a larger potential payout. When looking at a money line
	  	bet, you will see numbers next to both teams. For example, you might see Team 1 (-200) v. 
	  	Team 2 (+175). This can also be written Team 1 v. Team 2 (-200/+175). In short, these 
	  	numbers tell you what you can get for $100. Since Team 1 is -200, this means you would 
	  	have to bet $200 on this team to win $100. Since Team 2 is +175, this means you would win 
	  	$175 with a $100 bet. If the game ends in a tie, bet on a real sport. Only kidding, this 
	  	is called a "push", and all bettors are returned their original bet in full.
	  	<br>
	  	<strong>Takeaway:</strong> As is the case with a spread bet, the team with the (-) is the favorite. The 
	  	larger the number, the heavier they are favored to win - which means you have to bet more 
	  	money just to win the same $100. Something about risk/reward.. who knows. On the other
	  	hand, the team with the (+) is the underdog. The larger the number, the heavier they are 
	  	favored to lose - which means more winnings for the same $100 bet.
	  </p>
	  
	  <h3>
	  	Over/Under
	  </h3>
	  <p>
	  	Betting the over/under is basically just betting on how many total points will be scored 
	  	in a contest. When looking at an over/under bet, you will see one number next to the contest,
	  	usually labeled "Total Points".	For example, you might see Team 1 v. Team 2, Total Points:
	  	200.0. This means that you have to bet that Team 1 and Team 2 will either score more than 
	  	200 points combined or less than 200 points combined. If the two teams combine for this 
	  	exactly 200 points, this is called a "push", and all bettors are returned their original 
	  	bet in full.
	  	<br>
	  	<strong>Takeaway:</strong> If you think the game will be a higher scoring game than the 
	  	over/under line presents, take the over. If you think it will be a more heavily defensive
	  	game with less scoring than the over/under line presents, then take the under. Winning bets
	  	are paid 1:1.
